Thank you for your interest in helping with documenting the Fractureiser malware outbreak.

Please keep the following things in mind:
- Pull requests that perform bulk reformatting, automated or otherwise, **will be rejected**. This is because reformatting creates unwieldy diffs that result in cascading merge conflicts. Please just enable word-wrapping in your editor.
- Pull requests to add translations are very welcome; more languages makes it easier for non-English speakers to learn about the outbreak. Please see [#79](https://github.com/fractureiser-investigation/fractureiser/issues/79) for general discussion the translation community has had about how translations should be implemented. Our team primarily speaks English, and are not knowledgeable in translation, so we've delegated this to the community to ensure we wind up with a reasonable implementation.
- Many forms of "strange" formatting in this repo are wholly intentional, and PRs attempting to "correct" them will be intentional. A non-exhaustive list:
  - We refer to Fractureiser stages as e.g. "Stage0" — always capitalized and with no space.
  - "Fractureiser" is indeed not well-formed English; it should be "fracturizer" or "fracturiser", depending on dialect. It's kept as-is from the CurseForge account that spread the first samples we learned of.
- We do, however, welcome non-controversial formatting/grammar fixups. A lot of the documentation was written in a hurry and it's got various mistakes we've not caught.
  - This is not carte blanche to run automated grammar/spelling tools on the repo, such as Grammarly — the unguided output from these has a very obvious and poor style which we will reject on sight.
- The Discord guild is not official, and attempts to add links and references to it will be rejected. The mitigation team meets on IRC.
- Please tread carefully when attempting to add new guidance, as we've been pretty careful about how we're presenting the situation and how people should respond. We don't want to encourage people to be reckless when what's at stake is considered.
- ***Do not ask for samples***. If you have experience and credentials, that's great, but we have no way to verify this without using up tons of our team's limited time. Sharing malware samples is dangerous, even among people who know what they're doing.
- **Do not witchhunt, or encourage witchhunting, the author.** Online witchhunts do not go anywhere productive, and our focus is on the effects this has had on the community and how we can prevent it in the future.
- Any mention of blockchain or AI technology as a "solution" to future outbreaks is an instant ban.
